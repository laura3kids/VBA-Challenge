---
## Overview of Project

The goal of this project is to analyze stock data to inform consumers so they can make the most informed decisions on their investments. 

### Purpose

To analyze all the stock options for the two years for Steve so he can assist his parents in making the best financial decision on their investments. 

### Results

2017 proved to be a year that stocks had greater returns.  Only one stock in 2017, TERP, had a loss for -7.2% and SEDG had the highest return of 184.5%. 2018 proved to be the reverse situation, where only two stocks, ENPH and RUN, had a postive return of 81.9% and 84.0%, respetively and DQ had the greatest loss of -62.6%.

### Summary

There is an advantage to refactoring the code as the script runs faster.  Looping through all the data at one time made the code more efficient and therefore ran in less time. However, it was challenging to figure out how to refactor the original code and change my way of writing the original script.
